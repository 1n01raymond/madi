# MADI compiled-scene browser proof

This Vite app is the current Phase 1 runtime evidence, despite the historical
`webgpu-spike` directory name. It deliberately does not fetch the Phase 0 Scene
IR JSON.

```text
scene.gltf
  └─ main thread: validate profile, expose hierarchy and source identity
scene.bin
  └─ Worker: validate accessors, decode shared typed-array batches
       └─ direct WebGPU: surfaces, explicit CAD edges, object-ID picking
```

Run it with `pnpm dev`. Use `pnpm browser:matrix` for the reproducible headed
Chrome and Firefox visual/picking check.
